# GeoPouch v3.0.0 Testing Checklist

## Pre-Migration Verification

### Current Environment Assessment
- [ ] Document current PouchDB version in use
- [ ] Inventory all spatial queries in codebase
- [ ] Identify any custom spatial functions
- [ ] Note performance benchmarks for comparison
- [ ] Backup existing spatial databases

### Dependency Analysis
- [ ] Check Node.js version (must be 14+)
- [ ] Verify no direct `lie` library usage
- [ ] Confirm ES6+ compatibility in environment
- [ ] Review build tools compatibility

## Core Functionality Testing

### Basic Plugin Integration
- [ ] Plugin loads without errors
- [ ] `db.spatial` method is available
- [ ] Plugin registration works with `PouchDB.plugin()`
- [ ] No console errors during initialization

### Spatial Query Operations
- [ ] Inline function queries work: `db.spatial(function(doc) { emit(doc.geometry); }, bbox)`
- [ ] Design document queries work: `db.spatial('design/view', bbox)`
- [ ] Multiple bounding box formats accepted
- [ ] Point, LineString, Polygon geometries handled correctly
- [ ] Multi-geometry types (MultiPoint, etc.) work properly

### Database Operations
- [ ] Document insertion updates spatial index
- [ ] Document updates refresh spatial index
- [ ] Document deletion removes from spatial index
- [ ] Bulk operations work correctly
- [ ] Index persistence across database reopens

### Query Options
- [ ] `include_docs: true` returns full documents
- [ ] `stale: true` returns cached results
- [ ] Callback and Promise interfaces both work
- [ ] Error handling returns appropriate status codes

## Advanced Feature Testing

### View Management
- [ ] Dependent database creation works
- [ ] View caching functions correctly
- [ ] View cleanup on design doc deletion
- [ ] View updates when design doc changes
- [ ] Multiple views can coexist

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Query response times acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable for dataset size
- [ ] Index building completes in reasonable time
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended operation
- [ ] Concurrent query handling

### Error Conditions
- [ ] Invalid bounding box handled gracefully
- [ ] Malformed geometry objects rejected properly
- [ ] Missing design documents return 404
- [ ] Database connection errors handled
- [ ] Out of memory conditions handled

## Compatibility Matrix Testing

### Database Adapters
- [ ] IndexedDB adapter (browser)
- [ ] LevelDB adapter (Node.js)
- [ ] Memory adapter (testing)
- [ ] HTTP adapter (remote CouchDB)

### Environment Testing
- [ ] Node.js 14.x
- [ ] Node.js 16.x
- [ ] Node.js 18.x
- [ ] Node.js 20.x
- [ ] Chrome browser
- [ ] Firefox browser
- [ ] Safari browser
- [ ] Edge browser

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Works with PouchDB find plugin
- [ ] Compatible with replication
- [ ] Functions with sync gateway
- [ ] Coexists with other plugins

## Data Integrity Testing

### Geometry Validation
- [ ] Valid GeoJSON geometries accepted
- [ ] Invalid coordinates rejected
- [ ] Coordinate reference system handled
- [ ] Precision maintained in storage/retrieval

### Index Consistency
- [ ] Index matches document contents
- [ ] No orphaned index entries
- [ ] Index rebuilds produce same results
- [ ] Partial updates maintain consistency

### Transaction Safety
- [ ] Failed operations don't corrupt index
- [ ] Concurrent modifications handled safely
- [ ] Database recovery after unexpected shutdown
- [ ] Replication doesn't break spatial index

## Performance Benchmarks

### Query Performance
- [ ] Point-in-polygon queries under 100ms for 10k docs
- [ ] Bounding box queries under 50ms for 10k docs
- [ ] Complex geometry queries complete reasonably
- [ ] Performance degradation is linear with data size

### Index Performance
- [ ] Index building under 1 second for 1k docs
- [ ] Index updates under 10ms per document
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable for index size
- [ ] Disk usage reasonable for data size

### Scalability Testing
- [ ] Test with 1,000 documents
- [ ] Test with 10,000 documents
- [ ] Test with 100,000 documents (if applicable)
- [ ] Concurrent user simulation

## Regression Testing

### Legacy Query Patterns
- [ ] All v2.0.3 query patterns still work
- [ ] No breaking changes in result format
- [ ] Error messages remain consistent
- [ ] Performance not significantly degraded

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty result sets handled
- [ ] Very large bounding boxes work
- [ ] Very small bounding boxes work
- [ ] Queries crossing date line work
- [ ] Queries at poles work

## Deployment Testing

### Production Readiness
- [ ] No development dependencies in production build
- [ ] Minified/bundled version works correctly
- [ ] Source maps available for debugging
- [ ] Documentation matches implementation

### Migration Validation
- [ ] Existing spatial databases load correctly
- [ ] No data loss during migration
- [ ] Index rebuilds successfully
- [ ] Performance meets expectations

## Automated Test Suite Results
